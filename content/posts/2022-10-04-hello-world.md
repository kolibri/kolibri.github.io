# Need a problem?


You got a 4000x4000 matrix of boolean values.
You take a random snippet of an 8x8 field.
You want to locate this random piece in the big matrix.

What pattern of boolean values is needed?
How does locating the snippet work?

(From the Chessbots project, I just needed a first post...)
